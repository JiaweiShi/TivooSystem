Worldwide percussion icon Zakir Hussain is the son of legendary tabla player Alla Rakha, and returns to Page after a stunning concert there two years ago. Rakesh Chaurasia is the nephew and pupil of bansuri flute maestro Hariprasad Chaurasia. The bansuri is a simple tube of bamboo that is difficult to master and transcendent in tone. 

Pairing fluent rhythm and melody, these virtuosi tap into South Asian traditions to forge a sound where modernity and myth intertwine.

Zakir Hussain and Rakesh Chaurasia are presented, in part, with support from the Indian Classical Music and Dance Society</p></body></html>
